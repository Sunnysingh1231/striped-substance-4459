**Exception Handling**

SomthingWentWrongException is thrown when an operation fails (e.g., deleting a non-existent customer or CSR).

Database connection failures should be handled properly to avoid crashes.

**Notes**

Remove stm.execute(query); from coustmerLogin and ViewAllCsrs to prevent redundant execution.

Improve user input validation to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Consider using prepared statements for database queries to enhance security.
